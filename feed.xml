In 5 years it drops down to 125 million ADA per year. And in 10 years it’s about 40 million ADA.</p> <p>My thoughts on the Treasury withdrawals as a DRep and Cardano developer:</p> <ol> <li>I don’t mind <strong>once a year withdrawals</strong>. I think @radioastro made good arguments why this is OK during Cardano Summit presentation on Governance. It’s easier to plan, to vote, to hedge against the price volatility, etc.</li> <li>I’m <strong>against</strong> the idea of <strong>random withdrawals</strong> from the current Treasury. Treasury withdrawals should be <strong>sustainable</strong>. Thus we need a <strong>strategy</strong>.</li> <li>I suggest a <strong>maximum</strong> yearly governance budget to be all the <strong>Treasury yearly income + 10%</strong> of the current Treasury. The exact percentage can be debated but this approach is sustainable and allows for the Treasury to decrease forever.</li> <li>We can adjust the <strong>Treasury expenditure percent</strong> from 10% to -10% and it will go with the surplus.</li> <li>Right now I think we can spend some of the accrued Treasury as an <strong>investment</strong> into Cardano adoption. Maybe even 20% a year if it’s well argumented. As price goes up we can change to surplus. Think of this treasury expenditure percent as a meta-protocol parameter.</li> </ol> <div class="jupyter-notebook" style="position: relative; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="jupyter-notebook-iframe-container"> <iframe src="/notebooks/2024-Treasury.ipynb.html" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; border-style: none;" width="100%" height="100%" onload="this.parentElement.style.paddingBottom = (this.contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight + 10) + 'px'"></iframe> </div> </div> <h2 id="why-no-staking-for-treasury-withdrawals">Why No Staking For Treasury Withdrawals</h2> <p>The Treasury withdrawals <strong>should not be staked</strong>.</p> <p>According to Cardano Shelly <a href="https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-ledger/releases/latest/download/shelley-ledger.pdf">specification</a>, staking rewards are taken from the Reward pot, which is filled by the Reserves and Fees pots.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/value-preservation.png" alt="Preservation of Value" width="750"/></p> <p>When Treasury withdrawals are staked, the rewards are taken from the Rewards pot to Reward accounts. Thus less money goes to Treasury.</p> <p>This means that by staking the Treasury withdrawals we are decreasing Treasury income, essentially <strong>taking money</strong> from Treasury <strong>twice</strong>.</p> <h2 id="no-voting-with-treasury-withdrawals">No Voting With Treasury Withdrawals</h2> <p>Well, I think that’s obvious.

It’s the first one. Created by a noble and mysterious anonymous genius. Who disappeared and left the project to the community. Saint Satoshi Nakamoto.</p> <p>It’s energy converted to entropy and stored in a decentralized peer-to-peer network. The digital energy, the algorithmic scarcity, the digital gold. There will be only 21 million bitcoins, 21<sup>14</sup> satoshi ever.</p> <p>Many believe that, so be it.</p> <p>Bitcoin is reasonably simple, fairly stable. No hard forks since 2013 in Bitcoin Core.</p> <p>Bitcoin is unusable as a currency with 10 minutes blocks and 7 transactions per second. It’s a store of value, not a currency.</p> <p>Bitcoin is the Level 0. The Base Layer. The Sound Money in a world of Broken Money.</p> <h2 id="level-1">Level 1</h2> <p>We need to move money faster and cheaper. We need tokens. We need smart contracts.</p> <p>Blockchain of this level still needs to be decentralized, but it doesn’t have to be Proof-of-Work.</p> <p>All it needs is a secure, trustless and decentralized 2-way bridge to Bitcoin.</p> <p>These are my criteria for Level 1 blockchain:</p> <ul> <li>Proof-of-Stake</li> <li>Secure</li> <li>Decentralized</li> <li>Stable</li> <li>Fair distribution</li> <li>Smart Contracts</li> <li>Multi-asset</li> <li>Efficient Zero-Knowledge Proofs</li> <li>Fast</li> </ul> <p>I prefer Nakamoto Consensus over Byzantine Fault Tolerance as it’s more secure and decentralized.</p> <p>I see only two options here: Ethereum and Cardano.</p> <p>Everything else is lacking in one or more of these criterias.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/token-distribution.png" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/token-distribution.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>I think that Cardano is just a better technology than Ethereum.</p> <ul> <li>Cardano Ouroborous liquid Proof-of-Stake is better than Ethereum’s slashing Proof-of-Stake: <ul> <li>it’s more egalitarian as validators don’t have to be rich to participate</li> <li>stake is not locked and never at risk of being slashed</li> <li>peer-reviewed with a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf">formal proof of security</a></li> </ul> </li> <li>Cardano’s governance is better than Ethereum’s lack of governance</li> <li>Cardano never changed its monetary policy</li> <li>Cardano’s eUTxO model is a better than account model for zero-knowledge proofs</li> <li>Cardano transactions are deterministic, no wasted gas fees</li> <li>I believe that Cardano’s limited cap of Ada is better than Ethereum’s adaptive issuance model</li> <li>Cardano Native Assets are better than Ethereum ERC20 tokens</li> <li>there are further improvements in Cardano’s roadmap.</li> </ul> <p>Cardano is Level 1.</p> <p>Mutli-asset, eUTXO, predictable fees, deterministic transactions, smart contracts, zero-knowledge primitives, 20 seconds blocks.</p> <h2 id="level-2">Level 2</h2> <p>Fast BFT chains can become Level 2 sidechains of Level 1 blockchains. This is already happening with Cardano and Hydra, Cosmos and IBC, Polkadot and parachains.</p> <p>We can build a Lightning Network or <a href="https://ark-protocol.org/">Ark Protocol</a> on top of Cardano, and it will be more secure and decentralized than Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="bitcoin"/><category term="cardano"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Level 0 - Bitcoin]]></summary></entry></feed>

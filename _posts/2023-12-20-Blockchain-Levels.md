## Level 0 - Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the King.

I buy the narrative.
It's the first one.
Created by a noble and mysterious anonymous genius.
Who disappeared and left the project to the community.
Saint Satoshi Nakamoto.

It's energy converted to entropy and stored in a decentralized peer-to-peer network.
The digital energy, the algorithmic scarcity, the digital gold.
There will be only 21 million bitcoins, 21<sup>14</sup> satoshi ever.

Many believe that, so be it.

Bitcoin is reasonably simple, fairly stable. No hard forks since 2013 in Bitcoin Core.

Bitcoin is unusable as a currency with 10 minutes blocks and 7 transactions per second.
It's a store of value, not a currency.

Bitcoin is the Level 0. The Base Layer. The Sound Money in a world of Broken Money.

## Level 1

We need to move money faster and cheaper. We need tokens. We need smart contracts.

Blockchain of this level still needs to be decentralized, but it doesn't have to be Proof-of-Work.

All it needs is a secure, trustless and decentralized 2-way bridge to Bitcoin.

These are my criteria for Level 1 blockchain:

- Proof-of-Stake
- Secure
- Decentralized
- Stable
- Fair distribution
- Smart Contracts
- Multi-asset
- Efficient Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Fast

I prefer Nakamoto Consensus over Byzantine Fault Tolerance as it's more secure and decentralized.

I see only two options here: Ethereum and Cardano.

Everything else is lacking in one or more of these criterias.

I think that Cardano is just a better technology than Ethereum.

- Cardano Ouroborous liquid Proof-of-Stake is better than Ethereum's slashing Proof-of-Stake:
  - it's more egalitarian as validators don't have to be rich to participate
  - stake is not locked and never at risk of being slashed
  - peer-reviewed with a [formal proof of security](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf)
- Cardano's governance is better than Ethereum's lack of governance
- Cardano never changed its monetary policy
- Cardano's eUTxO model is a better than account model for zero-knowledge proofs
- Cardano transactions are deterministic, no wasted gas fees
- I believe that Cardano's limited cap of Ada is better than Ethereum's adaptive issuance model
- Cardano Native Assets are better than Ethereum ERC20 tokens
- there are further improvements in Cardano's roadmap.

Cardano is Level 1.

Mutli-asset, eUTXO, predictable fees, deterministic transactions, smart contracts, zero-knowledge primitives, 20 seconds blocks.

## Level 2

Fast BFT chains can become Level 2 sidechains of Level 1 blockchains.
This is already happening with Cardano and Hydra, Cosmos and IBC, Polkadot and parachains.

We can build a Lightning Network or [Ark Protocol](https://ark-protocol.org/) on top of Cardano, and it will be more secure and decentralized than Bitcoin's Lightning Network.

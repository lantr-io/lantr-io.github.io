## Cardano Voting Power Distribution

Basically, 24 DReps control 51% of the voting power in Cardano.

## Delegate

If you like what I'm doing, please, consider delegating your voting power to me:

CIP-105: [drep1k4h4cd5jknvcfeq5uuzqthpl7sdjxrwf9gn25tdk49qxyfhusgm](https://gov.tools/connected/drep_directory/drep1k4h4cd5jknvcfeq5uuzqthpl7sdjxrwf9gn25tdk49qxyfhusgm)

CIP-129: drep1y26k7hpkj26dnp8yznnsgpwu8l6pkgcdey4zd23dk655qcse26y3g
